	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
		Interesting that you have come here to take a peek of the lore behind this. Hi, I am Divyesh, a pre final year student pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My life revolves around tinkering constantly with new gadgets and software and learn about them. 
	</p>
	<p>
		From a very young age, I have always been fascinated by tech; Worked with computers of various sizes, shapes and architectures. I started to inculcate development habits from the age of 15. Having varied levels of experience and expertise in a variety of languages and frameworks that include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Flutter, Python, Express JS, MongoDB, and several creative skills including 3D modeling, video-editing, photo editing, blogging, designing interfaces and so on. There is a lot more untold!
	</p>

	<p>
		I was predominantly working in the frontend side of things - interfaces, UI designs, creative work, then slowly transitioning to scripting languages and then working on making things intelligent using ML. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I endeavour to work deeper on Operational Technology and put efforts on making them intelligent. I wish to apply the principles and concepts I have learnt throughout this journey and remix it with the new concepts I learn to create unique and rational intelligence solutions.
	</p>
	<h3>About this Blog</h3>
	<p>
		This blog focuses on exploring deeper into the roots of systems, the depths of hardware architectures whilst not completely deviating from my vision - to create intelligence accessible for all, all from a perspective of an ever learning student who has predominant experience and knowledge with full stack development! This blog is a space I created to record my technical explorations, my devlogs, and to create pieces of text that record the essense of new unexplored things which are vaguely available on the internet!
	</p>
	<h3>Old Blog</h3>
	<p>
		My old blog: <code>https://divyeshviews.blogspot.com</code> was my first blog and I'd say a fairly successful attempt until I abandoned it. I wanted to create a new space that deviates from the regular tech content and goes far and beyond the depths of traditional mainstream technology.
	</p>
	<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
	<p>
		This blog is powered by a robust tech stack comprising of: 
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Astro</li>
			<li>GitHub</li>
			<li>Vercel</li>
		</ul>
	
	

	<h3>Usage of AI</h3>
	<p>
	I advocate for the usage of artificial intelligence and LLMs to aid our tasks. I believe it has made education more accessible for all and with a structured strategy, one can gain invaluable knowledge and experience rather than just making it do repetitive tasks. My content won't be completely generated by AI, I will be using to structure points and build on it to ease the creative process. Any discrepancies can be informed as constructive criticism is highly appreciated!
	</p>
